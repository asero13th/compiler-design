## Overview

The JavaScript Arithmetic Operation Compiler is a project aimed at providing a solution for converting arithmetic operations in JavaScript code into C++ syntax. By doing so, it enables developers to integrate JavaScript arithmetic expressions seamlessly into C++ programs.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Expression Parsing**: The compiler parses arithmetic expressions written in JavaScript syntax.
- **Code Generation**: It generates equivalent C++ code for the parsed JavaScript expressions.
- **Integration**: The generated C++ code can be easily integrated into existing C++ projects.
- **Modular Design**: The project is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and enhance its functionality.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- CMake (for building)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asero13th/compiler-design.git
```
### Example
```bash
let a = 5;
let b = 3;
let result = a + b * 2;
console.log(result);
